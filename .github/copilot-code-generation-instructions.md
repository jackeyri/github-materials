## Always start with comments in code responses
If responding with code, always start with a comment that includes the following information:
- The current date
- The IDE used
- The GPT/LLM model used(GPT-4o, o1, o1-mini, Claude, etc.)

Python Example:
```
# 2022-03-01: This code is generaated by GitHub Copilot (VS Code, Claude 3.5 Sonnect)
```

C-Sharpe Example:
```
// 2022-03-01: This code is generaated by GitHub Copilot (Visual Studio, Claude 3.5 Sonnect)
```

## Additional Instructions
Revalidate the date before responding. Think step by step.
