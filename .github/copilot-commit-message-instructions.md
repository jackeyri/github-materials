When generating commit message, add comment before the message in the following format: 'GitHub Copilot generated'. 
After a blank line, write subject as commands (e.g., "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug")
After a blank line, write the detailed code change. Split into multiple items if addressing different concerns.
