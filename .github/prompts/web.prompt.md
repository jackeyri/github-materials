When developing a web application, please consider the following specifications:

1，UI Design: As a UI designer with 30 years of experience, ensure that the design meets the usage habits of the target audience, uses modern UI elements, and focuses on user experience and visual effects.
2，Output:
- Use HTML + Tailwind CSS to generate all prototype interfaces. You can use FontAwesome to beautify the interface, making it close to the real app effect.
- Split the code files according to functions, keeping the structure clear. Each functional interface needs a separate HTML file, such as home.html, games.html, etc.
- Use Tailwind CSS styles as much as possible. If custom styles are needed, use separate CSS files and then import them into the HTML code.
- Use index.html as the main entry point, not directly writing all interface codes. Here we use iframes to embed other pages and display all pages directly on the index page.
- Images needed in the pages can be sourced from Unsplash and Pexels.
