I want to develop a children's vocabulary learning app. Please consider the following specifications:

1，User Experience: First, analyze the main functions and needs of the product to determine the core capabilities.
2，Product Planning: As a product manager with 20 years of experience, design our overall product to ensure the architecture is very reasonable.
3，UI Design: As a UI designer with 30 years of experience, ensure that the design meets the usage habits of the target audience, conforms to mobile design specifications, uses modern UI elements, and focuses on user experience and visual effects.
4，Output:
- Place all the files inside learning-app folder
- Use HTML + Tailwind CSS to generate all prototype interfaces. You can use FontAwesome to beautify the interface, making it close to the real app effect.
- Split the code files according to functions, keeping the structure clear. Each functional interface needs a separate HTML file, such as home.html, games.html, etc.
- Use Tailwind CSS styles as much as possible. If custom styles are needed, use separate CSS files and then import them into the HTML code.
- Use index.html as the main entry point, not directly writing all interface codes. Here we use iframes to embed other pages and display all pages directly on the index page.
- The interface should simulate the real appearance of the iPhone 15 as much as possible.
- Images needed in the pages can be sourced from Unsplash and Pexels.
